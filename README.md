## About me

![A picture of Termilator](/images/termilaattori.png)

Hi! My name is Mila, I'm a second year student of information and communications
technology at LAB University of Applied Sciences in Lahti, Finland.
I am going to specialize in software development and am working hard on becoming
a better programmer and learning all that I can about the industry.

Some of my other interests are visual arts (mainly drawing and painting but some digital stuff too),
science, games and reading.


## Personal projects

### The Maze

![Screenshot of the start menu of the game](/images/alkuvalikko.png)

The Maze is a one level game made with Unity. The goal is to get through the maze as fast as possible. A timer runs in the upper corner and stops when the player gets out of the maze, and the final time is shown. The game scene also includes options to restart the level and to quit the game. When the player presses 'r', the timer is set to 0 and the player is moved to the beginning of the maze. Pressing 'q' takes the player back to the start menu.

The maze is about 300x200 meters big. It has a terrain and impenetrable walls made from basic cubes. Some details, like the eyes, tentacles and map pieces are hand made by me using Gimp and Blender. Other details, such as skeletons, the headless statue, vegetation and most textures (walls, ground, sky) are downloaded from the Unity asset store. All scripts are written by me, including the player and camera movement, the gameplay itself, the eyes following the player and the tentacle movement.

The maze design is inspired by the legendary hedgemaze in The Shining and is hand drawn by me.

The purpose of this project was to get familiar with Unity 3d. I had a pretty clear vision of what I wanted to make, and then just went with it. A lot of the solutions were found through trial and error and I'm sure a lot of it could have been done way more easily, but easy wasn't what I wanted. I wanted to learn. And I did.

### Binary clock

This clock shows the current time (24 hours: 59 minutes) using six digits, that have a total possible value of 64. Naturally, in a clock we only need to count to 59. The left side shows the hours (24), and the right side shows the minutes.

The point of this program is, in addition to being a great programming exercise for me, to play with binaries. They don't come up too often in everyday life, but reading them is good exercise for the brain, and for some people, even fun.

I wrote the program in Microsoft Visual Studio IDE in Python. It uses the datetime library to fetch current time, and tkinter library for the graphic window.
