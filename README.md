## About me

![A picture of Termilator](/images/termilaattori.png)

Hi! My name is Mila, I'm a second year student of information and communications
technology at LAB University of Applied Sciences in Lahti, Finland.
I am going to specialize in software and media technologies and am working hard on becoming
a better programmer and learning all that I can about the industry.

Some of my other interests are visual arts (drawing, painting, 2d and 3d digital art),
science, games and reading.


## Personal projects

### The Maze

![Screenshot of the start menu of the game](/images/alkuvalikko.png)

The Maze is a one level game made with Unity. The goal is to get through the maze as fast as possible. A timer runs in the upper corner and stops when the player gets out of the maze, and the final time is shown. The game scene also includes options to restart the level and to quit the game. When the player presses 'r', the timer is set to 0 and the player is moved to the beginning of the maze. Pressing 'q' takes the player back to the start menu.

The maze is about 300x200 meters big. It has a terrain and impenetrable walls made from basic cubes. Some details, like the eyes, tentacles and map pieces are hand made by me using Gimp and Blender. Other details, such as skeletons, the headless statue, vegetation and most textures (walls, ground, sky) are downloaded from the Unity asset store. All scripts are written by me, including the player and camera movement, the gameplay itself, the eyes following the player and the tentacle movement.

The maze design is inspired by the legendary hedgemaze in The Shining and is hand drawn by me.

The purpose of this project was to get familiar with Unity 3d. I had a pretty clear vision of what I wanted to make, and then just went with it. A lot of the solutions were found through trial and error and I'm sure a lot of it could have been done way more easily, but easy wasn't what I wanted. I wanted to learn. And I did.

### Binary clock

![Screenshot of my binary clock](/images/Binaryclock.jpg)

This clock shows the current time (24 hours: 59 minutes) using six digits, that have a total possible value of 64. Naturally, in a clock we only need to count to 59. The left side shows the hours (24), and the right side shows the minutes.

The point of this program is, in addition to being a great programming exercise for me, to play with binaries. They don't come up too often in everyday life, but reading them is good exercise for the brain, and for some people, even fun.

I wrote the program in Microsoft Visual Studio IDE in Python. It uses the datetime library to fetch current time, and tkinter library for the graphic window.

### Helicopter game (Mars attacks!)

![Screenshot of my helicopter game](/images/MarsAttacks.png)

A personal project for practicing HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

Some features:

- start by pressing any key
- play by pushing a button that keeps the helicopter in the air
- touching the ceiling/bottom of the screen or the buildings or the rays ends the game
- get score based on how far you get
- based on your final score, you get your pilot level

Published in itch.io with the name "Mars Attacks!"

Based on the [HTML Game Example of W3schools.](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp)

## School projects

### Unity game: Trouble At The Library (group project)

![Screenshot of game menu](/images/TLMenu1S.png)

Trouble At The Library was made for a course assignment, which was to make a game for the library of MÃ¤ntyharju. The customer wished for the game to have something to do with music, and possibly to be educational. I'm not sure what our game would teach children, but at least it's a whole lot of fun to play. The story of the game is that a group of evil robots from Mars have taken over a local library, and it's up to the player to defeat them. The robots' only weakness is music, so the player has to make their way to the librarys music room and play a loud song on a piano. To get there, they have to sneak around the library and collect notes. Flying robot guards patrol the area, and if they catch the player, they'll be thrown back to one of three starting points.

After collecting all the notes a door to a boss fight opens. The boss is an angry big robot that throws cannonballs at the player. If the player is hit, they lose some points and the robots rage meter goes down. When the player avoids a hit, the robot gets angrier and the rage meter goes up. When the rage meter is full, the robot explodes with anger and a door to the music room opens.

When the player approaches a piano in the music room, the scene changes to a piano game, where the player has to play a song (Fur Elise by Beethoven) following the color instructions. When the song is succesfully played, the library is freed.

There were seven people in our project group, and there was a lot of work for everyone. Many of the 3d game objects were made by ourselves, as well as all the graphics and scripting. My main role was to bring different elements together in Unity and programming the enemies and basic game logic (the pick ups, scoring, boss fight, opening doors etc.) I also did most of the 2d graphics (game logo, story scene, game over scene.) This was a big project, but we got it done on time and I'm very happy with the result. I learned so much about programming and how to work with Unity. This was also the first time I did something like this with a group of people, which was both challenging and rewarding. I feel like everyone got to use their individual talents but also got to learn new things.


### Unity game: Shark Valley

![Screenshot of the unity game](/images/house.png)

After making "The Maze" on my own, I started a game design course in school, focusing on Unity. In this course I've learned a lot about the possibilities of Unity and how to make enviroments and game mechanics. The big project of the course was to make a game area with an object collecting game. 
The finished project has different kinds of nature enviroments (forest, desert, lake etc.), sound effects (birds singing in forests, wind howling in the desert, water splashing), animations (a swimming shark and an elevator), particle effects (sandstorm and fire), buildings, props, 3rd person controls, functional UI and an objective of collecting all the floating coins as fast as possible within a time limit. The best time is recorded and displayed in the main menu, and can be erased.

The project uses a lot of assets from the asset store, so unlike in The Maze, many of the elements aren't made from scratch. Nevertheless, this was a great learning experience into the possibilities of Unity.

### JavaScript Adventure game

![Screenshot of my adventure game](/images/Seikkailupeli.jpg)

A finnish language fantasy adventure game. The game was build using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. The base was done with instructions and then continued by myself.
The game is played by writing certain commands on the text field. It features items, different ways to use them and a grid based map system.

The game was published in itch.io with the name "Talvikin seikkailu."
