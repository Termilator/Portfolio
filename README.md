## About me

![A picture of Termilator](/images/termilaattori.png)

Hi! My name is Mila, I'm a third year student of information and communications
technology at LAB University of Applied Sciences in Lahti, Finland.
I am going to specialize in software and media technologies and am working hard on becoming
a better programmer and learning all that I can about the industry.

Some of my other interests are visual arts (drawing, painting, 2d and 3d digital art),
science, games, reading, and staying up 48 hours for a game jam.


## Personal projects

### Work in progress: "A clever name for a cat game"

![Image of work in progress cat game](/images/KissapeliDemo2.png)

A personal 2d platformer game project, where you get to play as the amazing hero cat Mister Erkki. Your objective is to cheer up your depressed human by brining them all the best stuff (according to Mister Erkki), such as a super ball, toy mouse and snacks, before their depression bar reaches the top. You can lower the depression bar by kneading your human, as well as by bringing the items as fast as you can.

I will be updating this description as the project progresses.

### The Maze

![Screenshot of the start menu of the game](/images/alkuvalikko.png)

The Maze is a one level game made with Unity. The goal is to get through the maze as fast as possible. A timer runs in the upper corner and stops when the player gets out of the maze, and the final time is shown. The game scene also includes options to restart the level and to quit the game. When the player presses 'r', the timer is set to 0 and the player is moved to the beginning of the maze. Pressing 'q' takes the player back to the start menu.

The maze is about 300x200 meters big. It has a terrain and impenetrable walls made from basic cubes. Some details, like the eyes, tentacles and map pieces are hand made by me using Gimp and Blender. Other details, such as skeletons, the headless statue, vegetation and most textures (walls, ground, sky) are downloaded from the Unity asset store. All scripts are written by me, including the player and camera movement, the gameplay itself, the eyes following the player and the tentacle movement.

The maze design is inspired by the legendary hedgemaze in The Shining and is hand drawn by me.

The purpose of this project was to get familiar with Unity 3d. I had a pretty clear vision of what I wanted to make, and then just went with it. A lot of the solutions were found through trial and error and I'm sure a lot of it could have been done way more easily, but easy wasn't what I wanted. I wanted to learn. And I did.

### Binary clock

![Screenshot of my binary clock](/images/Binaryclock.jpg)

This clock shows the current time (24 hours: 59 minutes) using six digits, that have a total possible value of 64. Naturally, in a clock we only need to count to 59. The left side shows the hours (24), and the right side shows the minutes.

The point of this program is, in addition to being a great programming exercise for me, to play with binaries. They don't come up too often in everyday life, but reading them is good exercise for the brain, and for some people, even fun.

I wrote the program in Microsoft Visual Studio IDE in Python. It uses the datetime library to fetch current time, and tkinter library for the graphic window.

## School projects

### Unity game: shy ghost

![Game title](/images/PortfKansi.png)

Shy ghost was another course assignment, without much other requirements than that it has to be in 2D, have both desktop and mobile versions and have some kind of scoring system and basic game mechanics. I chose to make this game alone, since I wanted to learn more about several things I hadn't done before. These things included 2D graphics, animations and lighting. I got a small glimpse of these in a game jam I participated in a couple of months before this, and wanted to try them myself. Everything in the game (including programming, graphics, music, sounds etc.) was done by me.

![Screenshot of the game](/images/PortfHuone.png)

The objective of the game is to turn on all the lights in a dark mansion, while avoiding some enemies walking around the hallways. The desktop version is played with a keyboard.

The mobile version has a separate UI layer with buttons to move and pause the game.

### Unity game: Trouble At The Library (group project)

![Screenshot of game menu](/images/TLMenu1S.png)

Trouble At The Library was made for a course assignment, which was to make a game for the library of MÃ¤ntyharju. The customer wished for the game to have something to do with music, and possibly to be educational. I'm not sure what our game would teach children, but at least it's a whole lot of fun to play. The story of the game is that a group of evil robots from Mars have taken over a local library, and it's up to the player to defeat them. The robots' only weakness is music, so the player has to make their way to the librarys music room and play a loud song on a piano. To get there, they have to sneak around the library and collect notes. Flying robot guards patrol the area, and if they catch the player, they'll be thrown back to one of three starting points.

After collecting all the notes a door to a boss fight opens. The boss is an angry big robot that throws cannonballs at the player. If the player is hit, they lose some points and the robots rage meter goes down. When the player avoids a hit, the robot gets angrier and the rage meter goes up. When the rage meter is full, the robot explodes with anger and a door to the music room opens.

![Screenshot of game menu](/images/TLGame5S.png)

When the player approaches a piano in the music room, the scene changes to a piano game, where the player has to play a song (Fur Elise by Beethoven) following the color instructions. When the song is succesfully played, the library is freed.

There were seven people in our project group, and there was a lot of work for everyone. Many of the 3d game objects were made by ourselves, as well as all the graphics and scripting. My main role was to bring different elements together in Unity and programming the enemies and basic game logic (the pick ups, scoring, boss fight, opening doors etc.) I also did most of the 2d graphics (game logo, story scene, game over scene.) This was a big project, but we got it done on time and I'm very happy with the result. I learned so much about programming and how to work with Unity. This was also the first time I did something like this with a group of people, which was both challenging and rewarding. I feel like everyone got to use their individual talents but also got to learn new things.


### Unity game: Shark Valley

![Screenshot of the unity game](/images/house.png)

After making "The Maze" on my own, I started a game design course in school, focusing on Unity. In this course I've learned a lot about the possibilities of Unity and how to make enviroments and game mechanics. The big project of the course was to make a game area with an object collecting game. 
The finished project has different kinds of nature enviroments (forest, desert, lake etc.), sound effects (birds singing in forests, wind howling in the desert, water splashing), animations (a swimming shark and an elevator), particle effects (sandstorm and fire), buildings, props, 3rd person controls, functional UI and an objective of collecting all the floating coins as fast as possible within a time limit. The best time is recorded and displayed in the main menu, and can be erased.

The project uses a lot of assets from the asset store, so unlike in The Maze, many of the elements aren't made from scratch. Nevertheless, this was a great learning experience into the possibilities of Unity.

### React Native project: Movie App

The React Native course included many kinds of assignments, such as simple games, a map application, a to do-list, weather applications etc. But my favourite project was this movie application, because it was very challenging but also rewarding when I completed it. I learned a lot about React Native when making it. This was the task that really got me understanding how to use "hooks" and navigate between screens. 

The application fetches current movies playing in theaters from the movie database (themoviedb.org) and displays the as a list, with start of the movies description and a picture of the movies poster. When user taps on a title, the movies details are shown. If the movie data includes a trailer, it can be watched in full screen on a youtube player.
