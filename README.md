## About me

Hi! My name is Mila, I'm a second year student of information and communications
technology at LAB University of Applied Sciences in Lahti, Finland.
I am going to specialize in software development and am working hard on becoming
a better programmer and learning all that I can about the industry.

Some of my other interests are visual arts (mainly drawing and painting but some digital stuff too),
science, games and reading.


## Personal projects

### Binary clock

![Screenshot of my binary clock](/images/Binaryclock.jpg)

This clock shows the current time (24 hours: 59 minutes) using six digits, that have a total possible value of 64. Naturally, in a clock we only need to count to 59. The left side shows the hours (24), and the right side shows the minutes.

The point of this program is, in addition to being a great programming exercise for me, to play with binaries. They don't come up too often in everyday life, but reading them is good exercise for the brain, and for some people, even fun.

I wrote the program in Microsoft Visual Studio IDE in Python. It uses the datetime library to fetch current time, and tkinter library for the graphic window.
