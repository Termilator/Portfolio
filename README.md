## About me

Hi! My name is Mila, I'm a second year student of information and communications
technology at LAB University of Applied Sciences in Lahti, Finland.
I am going to specialize in software development and am working hard on becoming
a better programmer and learning all that I can about the industry.

Some of my other interests are visual arts (mainly drawing and painting but some digital stuff too),
science, games and reading.

I am currently looking for work/internship for summer 2021.
